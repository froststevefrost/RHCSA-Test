System Information:
  - RH-CSA-1, 10.10.1.2/24, gw=10.10.1.1, dns=10.10.1.1
  - RH-CSA-2, 10.10.1.3/24, gw=10.10.1.1, dns=10.10.1.1
  - Instant fail for the following misconfigurations:
    - Network settings
    - Root password
    - Bad ssh key

System Configuration

  - Common Configurations for both servers:
        - Network interfaces need to be configured
        - Root password needs to be set to Redhat123

        - Set timezone to Juneau
        - Set ntp to run correctly
        
        - create user "rhat" w/ password to Redhat123
        - grant the "rhat" user sudo rights
        - Create new ssh keys for "rhat" user on RH-Wkstn
        - Set /etc/ssh/sshd_config to disallow PasswordAuthentication and enforce PubKeyAuthentication
        - Configure RH-CSA-1 and RH-CSA-2 so that the rhat user is able to ssh without a password
        
        - Set each server's hostnames to reflect names in vCenter
        - Configure /etc/hosts to have the three systems defined on each server

        - yum.repos.d/redhat.repo should be configured to use RHSAT for both servers

Archive, copy, & redirection
  - On RH-CSA-1:
        - Archive the /home/$username/.bashrc and name it archive.zip
        - Transfer archive.zip from RH-CSA-1 to RH-CSA-2

  - On RH-CSA-2:
        - Unzip archive.zip into home dir, name the extracted file "archive.txt"
        - Change perms of archive.txt to 0440
        - Redirect the first 5 lines of archive.txt into a new file named "redirect-test"
        - Append the last 2 lines of archive.txt into the same file without overwriting

Everything Else
  - On RH-CSA-1:
        - Fix the process that is taking up CPU resources

        - Set default password age to be 90 days
        - Set $username's password to expire in 55 days from today

        - Create a cron job for user "rhat" to run at 13 minutes past every hour that logs "Cron job ran at $(date)" to /var/log/messages

        - Create a hard link in /home/user/links named services_copy, based on /etc/services
        - Create a symlink in /home/user/links named services_link, based on /etc/services
        - Grant the user "rhat" full rights to /home/user/links/services_copy
        - Grant the group "rhat" read rights to /home/user/links/services_copy

        - Make a new dir named /home/$user/test and create 99 directories in there named dir1 through dir99 that have 99 files in each that are named file1 through file99

        - Set the tuning profile to Virtual Guest on RH-CSA-1

  - On RH-CSA-2:
        - Create a PV, VG, and LV using /dev/sdb 
            - name should be "myVg" for the VG and "myLv" for the LV
        - Should be able to create a VDO on /dev/sdc
            - future release
        - Should be able to create a pool w/ stratis on /dev/sdd.
            - Should have the name "stratis" in it
        - Make a new directory named /home/$username/shares
        - Set a file access control list on /home/$username/shares to set defaults where $username has rw- perms for new files

        - Fix SELinux contexts on /newsite to figure out why httpd won't work
