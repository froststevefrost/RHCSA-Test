System Configuration

  - Common Configurations for both servers:
        - Network interfaces need to be configured
        - Root password needs to be set to Redhat123

        - Set timezone to Juneau
        - Set ntp to run correctly
        
        - create user "rhat" w/ password to Redhat123
        - grant the "rhat" user sudo rights w/ no prompt for password
        - Create new ssh keys for "rhat" user on RH-Wkstn
        - Configure RH-CSA-1 and RH-CSA-2 so that the rhat user is able to ssh without being prompted for a password
        - Set /etc/ssh/sshd_config to disallow PasswordAuthentication and enforce PubKeyAuthentication
        
        - Set each server's hostnames
        - Configure /etc/hosts to have the three systems defined on each server

        - yum.repos.d/MyAppStream.repo should be configured to use the install disk's AppStream directory as a repo
        - yum.repos.d/MyBaseOS.repo should be configured to use the install disk's BaseOS directory as a repo
        - both repositories should be enabled with no gpg key 

  - On RH-CSA-1:
        - Fix the process that is taking up CPU resources
        
        - Set default password age to be 90 days
        - Set $username's account to expire in 55 days from today

        - Archive the /etc/services and name it archive.tar.bzip2
        - Transfer archive.tar.bzip2 from RH-CSA-1 to rhat's home directory on RH-CSA-2

        - Create a cron job for user "rhat" to run at 13 minutes past every hour that logs "Cron job ran at $(date)" to /var/log/messages

        - Create a hard link in /home/user/links named services_copy, based on /etc/services
        - Create a symlink in /home/user/links named services_link, based on /etc/services
        - Grant the user "rhat" full rights to /home/user/links/services_copy
        - Grant the group "rhat" read rights to /home/user/links/services_copy

        - Make a new dir named /home/$user/test and create 99 directories in there named dir1 through dir99 that have 99 files in each that are named file1 through file99

        - Set the tuning profile to Virtual Guest
        
        - Create a container 
            As the rhat user, create a detached apache http web server container with the name "site1" and with the tag that has the lowest version (aside from version "1") from rhel8/httpd-24 image. 
            Use the registry.redhat.io registry, using your access.redhat.com username and password for the login
            Use the username "administrator" and the password of "admin123". Set them using the variables HTTPD_USER and HTTPD_PASSWORD
            Create and mount the ~/storage/html/ directory as a persistent storage to the container as /var/www/html. The contents of ~/storage/html should be extracted from /root/containers.tar.xz
            Also, port 8080 on the container should be mapped to port 8080 on the host.
            Make the web server/container persistent across reboots.
            You should be able to curl the website from any system on the local intranet.
